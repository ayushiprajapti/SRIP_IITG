# SRIP_IITG
Problem Statement 1
Step 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('respiration_data.csv')

# Handle missing values
data = data.fillna(method='ffill').fillna(method='bfill')

# Normalize the respiration signal
data['normalized_signal'] = (data['respiration_signal'] - data['respiration_signal'].mean()) / data['respiration_signal'].std()

# Reshape data for CNN
data_length = 100  # Example length of each time series segment
segments = []
labels = []
for i in range(0, len(data) - data_length, data_length):
    segment = data['normalized_signal'].values[i:i + data_length]
    segments.append(segment)
    labels.append(data['target'].values[i + data_length - 1])  # Assuming 'target' column has labels

X = np.array(segments)
y = np.array(labels)

# Reshape for CNN input
X = X.reshape(X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)
Step 2: Transfer Learning with a Pre-Trained Model
We'll use a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2) and fine-tune it on our data.

python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Conv1D, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 and customize for 1D input
base_model = MobileNetV2(input_shape=(data_length, 1, 3), include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(3, kernel_size=1, input_shape=(data_length, 1)))  # Adjust input to have 3 channels
model.add(base_model)
model.add(GlobalAveragePooling2D())
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
Step 3: Model Evaluation
python
# Evaluate the model's performance on the test set
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy}')
Step 4: Interpretation and Analysis
Interpret the predictions to identify apnea events and compare them with actual events.

Conclusion
By applying transfer learning and fine-tuning a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2, we can leverage pre-existing knowledge to enhance the detection of apnea events. This advanced approach demonstrates the power of combining state-of-the-art techniques with traditional machine learning workflows for better results in medical diagnostics.
