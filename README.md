Problem Statement 1
Step 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Step 2: Transfer Learning with a Pre-Trained Model
We'll use a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2) and fine-tune it on our data.
Step 3: Model Evaluation
Step 4: Interpretation and Analysis
Interpret the predictions to identify apnea events and compare them with actual events.
Conclusion
By applying transfer learning and fine-tuning a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2, 
we can leverage pre-existing knowledge to enhance the detection of apnea events. 
This advanced approach demonstrates the power of combining state-of-the-art techniques 
with traditional machine learning workflows for better results in medical diagnostics.
